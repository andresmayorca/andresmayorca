<h1>Hello there, I'm Andres ðŸ‘‹</h1> 

I'm a 15 years old developer, and I love building things.

I work as a blockchain developer on personal projects and developing different types of grants, I also develop personal projects and side projects for entertainment.

Some of the personal projects are:

- [Quadratic-Voting-With-Superfluid-Stream-Implementation](https://github.com/andresmayorca/Quadratic-Voting-With-Superfluid-Stream) - In this project I developed an implementation of superfluid streams with gitcoin quadratic voting rounds.
- [nft-dapp](https://github.com/andresmayorca/nft-dapp/blob/main/contracts/MyNFT.sol) - NFT'S minting contract
- [creyoncitosmagicos-web](https://github.com/andresmayorca/creyoncitosmagicos-web) - Website developed with django to set up courses, blogs and more.
